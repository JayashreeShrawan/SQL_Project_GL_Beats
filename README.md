Problem Statement Case Study
Business Context
GL-Beats is a music-based startup that  recently started selling music records online in multiple countries across the world. The executives at GL-Beats want to do a performance review and need a few recommendations on what genre their customers should be recommended and what artists they need to contract within specific countries according to their popularity.
Objective
As a Data Scientist, our goal is to explore the data available on Artists, Customers, and the Purchases made so far, and mainly give two recommendations driven by data:
●What are the top 3 popular genres in each country by ordered by purchases?
●Are there certain artists preferred more in some countries?
